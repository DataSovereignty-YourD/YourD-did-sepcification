# YourD DID Specification

## Motivation 

In the past, there existed a sacred contract of inviolable human ownership. Today, we believe that **a second ownership revolution is taking place in the digital realm**. This revolution is centered around **digital ownership**. Indeed, all derivative data and activities that occur when individuals utilize digital services belong to the individual. Numerous tech giants and traditional companies have amassed substantial profits by exploiting our data, utilizing it for targeted advertising and financial services. Our objective is to reclaim our rights from these entities and redefine the perception surrounding digital ownership. This entails establishing data sovereignty over ourselves.

Europe and North America are advocating for robust data laws such as GDPR and ADDPA. They seek a new paradigm, a game-changer. Our aim is to build the most crucial infrastructure and services with privacy as the foundation, thereby enabling the emergence of a monumental movement known as Web3. This is the essence of YourD service.

We have identified three fundamental components for constructing Web3 services: **prove, own, and apply**. These components must remain distinct. YourD encompasses the prove and own aspects, empowering individuals to validate and assert their ownership.
